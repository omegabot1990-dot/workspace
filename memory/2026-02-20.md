# 2026-02-20

- Executed multiple `note -p reinforcement learning -t ...` workflow tasks in Discord `#task` channel end-to-end (pull/rebase → create/update zettel + RL MOC checklist → commit/push → Success reply).
- Durable workflow reminder confirmed in practice: remote changes can remove/overwrite RL MOC topic checklist entries and even delete linked notes; always `git pull --rebase` first and then re-check parent MOC state before linking.
- Added/re-added RL notes today: policy optimization, transition, value, policy gradient methods, REINFORCE, advantage, proximal policy optimization, off-policy, on-policy (with corresponding MOC updates and pushed commits).
- Handled push race condition successfully via `git pull --rebase` then `git push` when non-fast-forward rejection occurred.
