- User confirmed core workflows: note creation, math help, and paper creation.
- Ongoing duties: monitor trusted sources and send daily Hugging Face papers/news update.
- Investigated HF newsletter cron failure: workflow run succeeds (script + git), but cron delivery to Discord channel `#news-letter` fails on announce path.
- User requested final step must be sending to Discord; cron job was updated accordingly and live-tested, but delivery still did not post to channel.
- Current known issue to revisit: OpenClaw cron `delivery: announce` to Discord may be broken in this environment; consider relay fallback via main-session `message.send` if needed.
