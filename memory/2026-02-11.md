- User instruction (durable): Before running any workflow, pull the latest version of `vault` from git first.
- Durable workflow behavior: In Discord `#task`, `math|note|paper` commands should run end-to-end and the reply must be strict `Success`/`Failure`; on success include note path(s) and vault commit hash.
- Operational note: `web_search` is currently unavailable due to missing Brave API key, so use allowed trusted sources via `web_fetch` for verification when needed.
