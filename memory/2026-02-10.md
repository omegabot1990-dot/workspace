# 2026-02-10

- Configured Discord access for OpenClaw bot:
  - Allowed user ID `1280105955375448081` in `channels.discord.guilds.omega.users`.
  - Removed channel-specific restriction so bot can operate across all channels in guild `omega`.
- Restarted gateway service via CLI flow; verified healthy with `openclaw status --deep` and Discord state `OK`.
- Installed Homebrew on host (`/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew`), verified `Homebrew 5.0.14`.
- Added Homebrew shell init to `~/.bashrc` and `~/.profile`.
