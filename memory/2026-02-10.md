# 2026-02-10

- Configured Discord access for OpenClaw bot:
  - Allowed user ID `1280105955375448081` in `channels.discord.guilds.omega.users`.
  - Removed channel-specific restriction so bot can operate across all channels in guild `omega`.
- Restarted gateway service via CLI flow; verified healthy with `openclaw status --deep` and Discord state `OK`.
- Installed Homebrew on host (`/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew`), verified `Homebrew 5.0.14`.
- Added Homebrew shell init to `~/.bashrc` and `~/.profile`.
- GitHub backup workflow:
  - Repo for workspace backups: https://github.com/omegabot1990-dot/workspace
  - When user says **"backup the workspace"**, stage/commit/push all workspace Markdown files (`*.md` and `memory/*.md`) plus `README.md` to that repo.
  - Scheduled daily backup cron: 02:00 Europe/Amsterdam.
- User timezone/location: Netherlands (Europe/Amsterdam).

- Vault workflow rules (Batman):
  - Vault is the shared knowledge graph for research.
  - Inbox items must use the inbox template, start with `status: Backlog`, include `description`, and classify: `task type` (capture/organise/distil/plan/execute), `urgency level` (urgent/not urgent), `importance level` (important/not important).
  - Zettels use timestamped filenames + zettel template; zettel kinds: `paper | note | code | math`.
    - `paper`: summary of a paper.
    - `note`: leaf/atomic concept node (e.g. objective function) with parent (zettel or MOC) and links to other zettels.
    - `code` / `math`: paradigms TBD by Batman.
  - MOCs are high-level concept maps that primarily link to zettels and contain minimal/no content.
  - `[[research.base]]` is the root parent.
  - Every new MOC/Zettel must link to a parent MOC or Zettel (graph connectivity).
  - Paper workflow: one zettel per paper, then an MOC of the paper’s concepts; assistant does BFS capture, Batman does DFS deep study.
  - Child nodes field removed (do not maintain `child nodes`).
  - Annotation target removed (do not maintain `annotation-target`).
  - MOC practice: when a zettel exists, include it in the parent MOC as a checked link item: `- [x] [[<zettel>|<Concept>]]`
  - Writing style: avoid full stops at the end of bullet lines
  - Zettel timestamping: generate filename timestamps in Europe/Amsterdam (DST-aware) `YYYYMMDDHHMM`
  - Learning workflow split:
    - Assistant creates zettels with a very concise summary (simple words)
    - Assistant adds a `[!MATH]` block only when there is actual math (definition/formula)
    - When writing math, use Obsidian LaTeX (inline `$...$`, display `$$...$$`)
    - Assistant does not add highlights or citations
    - Assistant only links zettels to the MOC; Batman creates the internal mappings/highlights/citations during study
- Highlighting convention:
  - Use `<mark style="background: ...;">...</mark>` highlights (not `==...==`).
  - Apply the urgency/importance color scheme (Deep Work/Strategic Planning/AI Co-Pilot/Curate & Stack/AI Auto-Pilot/Archive).
  - Add an action hint tag like `<important>` / `<do later>` / `<quick read>` near highlighted items.

- Research folder style snapshot (2026-02-10, after cleanup):
  - `002 - research/` contains 177 markdown notes; 100% use YAML frontmatter with `tags`, `description`, `parent nodes`, `child nodes`.
  - Filename styles: ~half timestamped zettels (`YYYYMMDDHHMM - ...`), ~half plain topic files (often MOCs).
  - Parent nodes are always a YAML list (median length 1).
  - MOCs frequently use checkbox resource lists (`- [ ] [Title](URL)`) with short sub-bullets.
  - Highlights: 74 notes currently contain `<mark style="background: ...">`.
  - Legacy `[[003 - genesis/research/...]]` links were normalized to updated wikilinks.

- Templates update (2026-02-10):
  - Added/confirmed tag `meta` for topics outside research (currently used on: blogs, labs, research tools, highlights, todo, random ideas)
  - Added frontmatter field `bot: <bool>` to mark whether a note is AI-made
  - Assistant must set `bot: true` on notes it creates
  - MOCs are Batman-owned; remove `bot` from MOC template and do not add `bot` to MOC notes
  - MOC template now has 5 sections: `## Topics`, `## Blogs`, `## Papers`, `## Videos`, `## Code`
  - Classifier rules:
    - GitHub links → Code
    - wandb/VastAI/tools/services → Blogs
    - Paper platforms (alphaXiv/arXiv/OpenReview/etc) → Papers
    - YouTube → Videos
  - When reorganizing MOCs, only move top-level list items; keep sub-items with their parent

- Zettel workflow spec (locked, 2026-02-10):
  - Applies to 3 zettel types: `math`, `note`, `paper`
  - Creation command standard:
    - `math -p <parent> -t <topic>`
    - `note -p <parent> -t <topic>`
    - `paper -p <parent> -t <paper link>`
  - Global:
    - Timestamp filenames in Europe/Amsterdam
    - Avoid meta-commentary like “in this vault” inside zettel content
    - `bot: true` and `description: ''`
    - Bullet style: concise, simple words + correct jargon, no trailing full stops
    - No highlights, no citations
    - Obsidian LaTeX for math (`$...$`, `$$...$$`)
  - `note` zettels:
    - `title`: lowercase
    - `aliases`: appropriate casing
    - verify via trusted sources (list in `trusted_sources.md`)
    - add `[!MATH]` only if there is an actual definition/formula
  - `math` zettels:
    - keep framing purely mathematical (no ML/application motivation)
    - `title`: lowercase
    - `aliases`: appropriate casing
    - verify via trusted sources (list in `trusted_sources.md`)
    - include `[!MATH]` only if there is an actual definition/formula
    - math callouts should be fully defined (Mean-style): short title + one-line description + LaTeX `$$...$$`
    - example run confirmed: `math linear algebra scalar` + `math linear algebra vectors`
  - `paper` zettels:
    - Batman provides alphaXiv URL
    - `title`: lowercase with `:`→`-`
    - `aliases`: alphaXiv header text verbatim
    - sections: `Topics (not in KG yet)` then Summary/Problem/Method/Result/Take Away/Limitations/Future Work
    - embed alphaXiv figures via `![](<url>)`
    - missing topics: normalized topic-name match vs existing zettel topics; if unsure include
  - MOC updates: after creating zettel, update the parent MOC you provided; if missing add it to correct section and mark done
  - Verified sweep: checked MOCs for stranded second-layer `- [ ]` items; none remain after fixes

- Research graph: first root layer after `[[research.base]]` (2026-02-10)
  - Core top-level MOCs / roots (parent = `[[research.base]]`):
    - `[[blogs]]` (sources / newsletters)
    - `[[labs]]` (research org publication feeds)
    - `[[research tools]]` (tools/process for research)
    - `[[highlights]]` (priority/highlighting scheme reference)
    - `[[todo]]` (research TODO capture)
    - `[[random ideas]]` (idea parking lot)
    - `[[machine learning]]`
    - `[[deep learning]]`
    - `[[reinforcement learning]]`
    - `[[math]]`
    - `[[code]]`
  - One additional root-level thesis note:
    - `[[202601101646 - is tool use a way towards domain adaptation?]]` (thesis-style research framing)

- Math subtree conventions (2026-02-10)
  - Root math node: `[[math]]` is a `moc` + `math` + `root` note under `[[research.base]]`.
  - First layer under `[[math]]`:
    - `[[probability and statistics]]` (MOC)
    - `[[information theory]]` (MOC)
    - `[[202602061044 - hadamard product|Hadamard product]]` (math zettel)
  - Math MOC style:
    - Very light content; usually a checklist of questions/resources (e.g. `- [ ] What is probability?`).
  - Math zettel style (tags include `math`, timestamped filename):
    - Start with a few plain-language bullets (definition/intuition), with links to related zettels.
    - Use Obsidian callouts for formal definitions/formulas:
      - `> [!MATH] <short title>`
      - Put LaTeX in `$$ ... $$` inside the callout.
      - Optionally add short parameter notes as bullets within the callout.
    - Use footnote references (`[^1]`) to point to sources (D2L, StatQuest/3Blue1Brown, etc.).
    - Use `<mark style="background: ...;">...</mark>` highlights sparingly to emphasize key terms.

- Vault maintenance (2026-02-10):
  - Pulled latest vault changes; a note was renamed from `202601282131 - instruct gpt.md` to `202601282131 - training language models to follow instructions with human feedback.md`.
  - Removed stray empty `work.md` that was accidentally added at vault root (committed + pushed removal).

- Paper workflow test completed (2026-02-10)
  - Parent MOC: `[[reinforcement learning verifiable rewards]]`
  - alphaXiv: https://www.alphaxiv.org/abs/2503.19470 (canonical v3)
  - Created paper zettel: `002 - research/202602102118 - research- learning to reason with search for llms via reinforcement learning.md`
    - `title`: `research- learning to reason with search for llms via reinforcement learning` (lowercase, `:`→`-`)
    - `aliases`: `ReSearch: Learning to Reason with Search for LLMs via Reinforcement Learning` (verbatim)
    - `bot: true`, `description: ''`, `tags: [paper]`
    - Includes required sections and alphaXiv figure embeds
  - Updated parent MOC `reinforcement learning verifiable rewards.md` under `## Papers` with checked link to the new zettel
  - Extraction workaround for JS-heavy alphaXiv pages
    - Fetch `/overview/<id>` HTML and parse embedded dehydrated state with regex to recover summary, arrays (problem/solution/key insights/results), topics, and figure asset URLs
    - Figure assets follow pattern `https://paper-assets.alphaxiv.org/figures/<paperid>v<ver>/img-<n>.jpeg`
