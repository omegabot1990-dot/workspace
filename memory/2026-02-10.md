# 2026-02-10

- Configured Discord access for OpenClaw bot:
  - Allowed user ID `1280105955375448081` in `channels.discord.guilds.omega.users`.
  - Removed channel-specific restriction so bot can operate across all channels in guild `omega`.
- Restarted gateway service via CLI flow; verified healthy with `openclaw status --deep` and Discord state `OK`.
- Installed Homebrew on host (`/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew`), verified `Homebrew 5.0.14`.
- Added Homebrew shell init to `~/.bashrc` and `~/.profile`.
- GitHub backup workflow:
  - Repo for workspace backups: https://github.com/omegabot1990-dot/workspace
  - When user says **"backup the workspace"**, stage/commit/push all workspace Markdown files (`*.md` and `memory/*.md`) plus `README.md` to that repo.
  - Scheduled daily backup cron: 02:00 Europe/Amsterdam.
- User timezone/location: Netherlands (Europe/Amsterdam).
- User preferences captured:
  - Name: Batman
  - Preferred address: Dark Knight / DN
  - Response style: concise by default; explain when asked.
- Project purpose + direction:
  - Assistant role: research assistant / co-scientist
  - Research: large language models; focus on reinforcement learning for LLMs
  - Second brain: Obsidian vault stored locally under `workspace/vault` and pushed to GitHub repo `omegabot1990-dot/vault` (daily 02:00 Europe/Amsterdam)
- Vault workflow rules (Batman):
  - Vault is the shared knowledge graph for research.
  - Inbox items must use the inbox template, start with `status: Backlog`, include `description`, and classify: `task type` (capture/organise/distil/plan/execute), `urgency level` (urgent/not urgent), `importance level` (important/not important).
  - Zettels (note/paper/definition/code/math) must use zettel template; MOCs must use MOC template.
  - Every new MOC/Zettel must link to a parent MOC or Zettel (graph connectivity).
  - Learning workflow: breadth-first concept capture from papers (assistant does BFS); Batman then does depth-first study to deepen/expand zettels.
- Highlighting convention:
  - Use `<mark style="background: ...;">...</mark>` highlights (not `==...==`).
  - Apply the urgency/importance color scheme (Deep Work/Strategic Planning/AI Co-Pilot/Curate & Stack/AI Auto-Pilot/Archive).
  - Add an action hint tag like `<important>` / `<do later>` / `<quick read>` near highlighted items.
